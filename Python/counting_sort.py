"""
    Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorthm!

    What it does is instead of comparing elements,
    it keeps track of the elements when sweeping through the array,
    and places them into a new array accordingly.

    For an array of n positive integers with maximum k,
    the running time is O(n+k).

    The reason why it can achieve linear time
    without breaking the Î©(n log n) lower bound is because
    it is NOT a comparison sort, which was the only assumption
    when proving the lower bound.
